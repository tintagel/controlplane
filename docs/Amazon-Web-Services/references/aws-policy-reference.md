# AWS IAM Policy Reference
The best reference for AWS IAM policies is the combination of the AWS IAM documentation, and the documentation for each service you want to manage with IAM.  Generally, each API action for any given AWS service can be managed in IAM policy.  There are of course exceptions.

## Can I just get a quick reference?
Yes!

Check out the AWS Policy Generator: https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html

Or if you want a more programmatically consumable list, use the one that the AWS Policy Generator uses: https://awsiamconsole.s3.amazonaws.com/iam/assets/js/bundles/policies.js
